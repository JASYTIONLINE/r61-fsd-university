# So You Want to be a Full Stack Engineer?

Welcome! You're about to embark on a journey to become a **full Stack Web Application Engineer**. This course will teach you the essential skills needed to build modern web applications from the ground up.

## What is a Full Stack Engineer?

A **full stack engineer** is a developer who can work on both the **front-end** and **back-end** of web applications. This means you'll be able to:

- **Front-end Development**: Build the user interface that people see and interact with in their browsers. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.

- **Back-end Development**: Create the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power web applications. This includes working with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB.

- **Full Stack Integration**: Connect front-end and back-end systems to create complete, functional web applications.

The term "full stack" refers to working across the entire technology stack—from the user interface all the way down to the database and server infrastructure.
