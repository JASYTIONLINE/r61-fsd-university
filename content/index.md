# So You Want to be an Engineer?

Welcome! You're about to embark on a journey to become a **full stack engineer**. This course will teach you the essential skills needed to build modern web applications from the ground up.

---

## What is a Full Stack Engineer?

A **full stack engineer** is a developer who can work on both the **front-end** and **back-end** of web applications. This means you'll be able to:

- **Front-end Development**: Build the user interface that people see and interact with in their browsers. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.

- **Back-end Development**: Create the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power web applications. This includes working with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB.

- **Full Stack Integration**: Connect front-end and back-end systems to create complete, functional web applications.

The term "full stack" refers to working across the entire technology stack—from the user interface all the way down to the database and server infrastructure.

## What This Course Covers

This course is part of a comprehensive full stack development program that will teach you the **MERN stack**:

- **M**ongoDB - Database for storing application data
- **E**xpress - Web framework for building APIs and server logic
- **R**eact - Front-end library for building interactive user interfaces
- **N**ode.js - JavaScript runtime for server-side development

In this **Foundations of Front-end Development** section, we focus on building the essential skills you'll need:

1. **File Systems and Organization** - Understanding why logical file structures matter and how to organize projects professionally
2. **Version Control** - Professional Git and GitHub workflows
3. **HTML & CSS** - Building and styling web pages
4. **JavaScript Fundamentals** - Core programming concepts
5. **Advanced JavaScript** - Functions, optimization, and modern features
6. **Modern Tools** - Tailwind CSS and advanced front-end techniques

Each lesson builds on the previous one, and you'll work with a single repository that becomes a portfolio piece demonstrating your professional development skills.
