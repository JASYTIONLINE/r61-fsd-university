# Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Windows computer
- Access to the Microsoft Store (or ability to download from GitHub)
- About 5 minutes

**Note:** Windows Terminal is optional but recommended. If you prefer, you can skip this exercise and use Git Bash directly (which you'll install in the next exercise).
Getting Started

## What are we doing?

By the end of this exercise, you will have:
- Windows Terminal (also called the Command Line Interface) installed
- Windows Terminal configured as your default terminal
- Verified that Windows Terminal is working

**Note:** This exercise is part of the [Orientation Section](c01-found/s0-welcome/index). Read each section fully before performing the steps.

5. Click **Install** or **Get**
6. Wait for installation to complete

**Alternative method (if store doesn't work):**
1. Go to [github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases)

## Step 2: Configure Windows Terminal (Optional)

### What This Step Does
This sets up Windows Terminal to use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git) as a profile option (you'll install Git Bash in the next exercise).
### Instructions
1. Open Windows Terminal
2. Click the dropdown arrow next to the new tab button
3. You should see options like "powershell", "command prompt", etc.
4. ![](ss-terminal-opts.png)
5. After you install Git Bash (in Exercise 2), it will automatically appear here

**Note:** We'll configure Git Bash integration after installing Git in Exercise 2.

### Verify
You should see:
- ✅ Windows Terminal opens successfully
- ✅ You can see the terminal interface
- ✅ You can create new tabs

---

## Expected State at the End of This Exercise

You should now have:
- **Windows Terminal**: Installed and accessible from the start menu
- **Basic Configuration**: Ready to add Git Bash in the next exercise

---

## Why This Matters

Windows Terminal provides:
- Better visual experience than default command prompt
- Multiple tabs for different shells
- Better customization options
- Integration with Git Bash, PowerShell, and other tools

While optional, Windows Terminal makes working with the command line more pleasant and professional.
