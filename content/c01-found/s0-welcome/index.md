# So You Want to be an Engineer?

Welcome! You're about to embark on a journey to become a **full stack engineer**. This orientation will help you understand what that means, what you'll need to succeed, and what lies ahead in this course.

---

## What is a Full Stack Engineer?

A **full stack engineer** is a developer who can work on both the **front-end** and **back-end** of web applications. This means you'll be able to:

- **Front-end Development**: Build the user interface that people see and interact with in their browsers. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.

- **Back-end Development**: Create the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power web applications. This includes working with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB.

- **Full Stack Integration**: Connect front-end and back-end systems to create complete, functional web applications.

The term "full stack" refers to working across the entire technology stack—from the user interface all the way down to the database and server infrastructure.

---

## What This Course Covers

This course is part of a comprehensive full stack development program that will teach you the **MERN stack**:

- **M**ongoDB - Database for storing application data
- **E**xpress - Web framework for building APIs and server logic
- **R**eact - Front-end library for building interactive user interfaces
- **N**ode.js - JavaScript runtime for server-side development

In this **Foundations of Front-end Development** section, we focus on building the essential skills you'll need:

1. **File Systems and Organization** - Understanding why logical file structures matter and how to organize projects professionally
2. **Version Control** - Professional Git and GitHub workflows
3. **HTML & CSS** - Building and styling web pages
4. **JavaScript Fundamentals** - Core programming concepts
5. **Advanced JavaScript** - Functions, optimization, and modern features
6. **Modern Tools** - Tailwind CSS and advanced front-end techniques

Each lesson builds on the previous one, and you'll work with a single repository that becomes a portfolio piece demonstrating your professional development skills.

## Prerequisites for Success

You don't need any prior programming experience to start this course, but here's what will help you succeed:

### Essential Requirements

- **A Windows Computer**: This course is taught for Windows users. While most development concepts are the same across Windows, Mac, and Linux, the instructions and examples in this course are Windows-specific. If you're using Mac or Linux, you may need to do additional research to adapt certain steps to your system.
- **Internet Connection**: You'll need reliable internet to access GitHub, download tools, and follow along
- **Time Commitment**: Set aside regular time for practice. Consistency matters more than long sessions
- **Curiosity and Patience**: Learning to code takes time. Be patient with yourself and stay curious

### Basic Computer Skills Expected

This course assumes you have basic computer skills. We won't teach you how to:
- Open File Explorer or navigate folders
- Open a terminal or command prompt
- Create, rename, or delete files and folders
- Use basic keyboard shortcuts (copy, paste, save, etc.)

**We will teach you:**
- How to use the command line once it's open
- Git commands and workflows
- How to use VS Code
- Programming concepts and syntax

If you need help with basic computer operations (like opening a terminal or navigating File Explorer), use ChatGPT, Google, or other resources to fill those knowledge gaps. This keeps the course material focused on development skills rather than basic computer literacy.

**Most students will never have worked in a command-line environment before.** That's okay—we'll take you through how to use the command line interface step by step. You just need to be able to open it first.

### Helpful (But Not Required)

- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Enjoying puzzles and logical thinking will help
- **Attention to Detail**: Programming requires precision—small details matter
- **Willingness to Practice**: The more you code, the better you'll become
- **Comfort with Self-Directed Learning**: Being able to look up basic OS operations when needed

### Tools You'll Install in This Section

In the exercises below, you'll install:
- **Windows Terminal** - Modern terminal application (optional but recommended)
- **Git for Windows** - Version control system (includes Git Bash)
- **VS Code** - Industry-standard code editor
- **GitHub Account** - Online code hosting platform
- **GitHub Desktop** - Visual interface for Git and GitHub

**Later in the course:**
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime (installed in a later section)
- **Browser Developer Tools** - Already in your web browser

Don't worry if these sound unfamiliar now. We'll walk you through everything step by step.

## Course Environment: Windows Focus

This course is designed for **Windows users**. While the core development concepts (Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) work the same across all operating systems, the specific instructions, file paths, and tool setup in this course are Windows-focused.

**If you're using Mac or Linux:**
- Most concepts will translate directly
- File paths may differ (Windows uses `\`, Mac/Linux use `/`)
- Some installation steps may vary
- Terminal commands are generally the same, but some Windows-specific commands won't apply
- You may need to do additional research to adapt certain steps

**Why Windows?**
Windows is the most widely used operating system, and many professional development environments run on Windows. Learning on Windows prepares you for the most common professional scenario.

**If you encounter platform-specific issues:**
- Use ChatGPT or Google to find Mac/Linux equivalents
- The core concepts remain the same—only the specific commands or paths may differ
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind each step, not just the "what"

---

## How Lessons Are Structured

Each lesson in this course follows a consistent structure to help you learn effectively:

- **Lecture** - Found in the `lecture/` folder, these materials introduce concepts and explain the "why" behind what you're learning
- **Exercise** - Found in the `exercise/` folder, these hands-on activities let you practice what you've learned
- **Lab** - Found in the `lab/` folder, these assignments help you apply your knowledge to real scenarios

This structure allows you to learn at your own pace: read the lecture materials, practice with exercises, and demonstrate your understanding through labs.

## What Makes This Course Different

This course is designed as a **workbook**—meaning you can learn at your own pace without needing an instructor present. Here's what to expect:

- **Self-Paced Learning**: Work through lectures, exercises, and labs when it fits your schedule
- **One Continuous Project**: All lessons build on a single repository, not throwaway demos
- **Professional Habits**: Learn industry-standard practices from day one, starting with file organization
- **Portfolio Ready**: Your final project will be something you can show to employers
- **Beginner Friendly**: No prior experience assumed—we explain everything

## Welcome to the Course

You're about to learn skills that are in high demand. Full stack engineers work at startups, large tech companies, agencies, and as freelancers. The skills you'll develop here are the foundation of modern web development.

**Remember**: Every expert was once a beginner. Don't be discouraged if things feel challenging at first. That's normal and expected. The key is to keep going, practice regularly, and build on what you learn each day.

This course is designed to take you from zero to building real web applications. We start with understanding file organization—a fundamental skill that makes everything else easier. Then you'll learn version control, web development, and programming. Take your time, follow the lectures, complete the exercises, and work through the labs. Don't skip the explanations—they're there for a reason.
