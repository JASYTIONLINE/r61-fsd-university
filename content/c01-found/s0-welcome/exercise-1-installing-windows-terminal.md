# Exercise 1: Installing Windows Terminal

This exercise is written so you can complete it **without an instructor present**.
Read each section fully before performing the steps.

This exercise is part of the [[s0-welcome/index|Orientation section]]. Windows Terminal provides a better command-line experience than the default Windows command prompt.

---

## What You Are Building

By the end of this exercise, you will have:
- Windows Terminal installed
- Windows Terminal configured as your default terminal
- Verified that Windows Terminal is working

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Windows computer
- Access to the Microsoft Store (or ability to download from GitHub)
- About 5 minutes

**Note:** Windows Terminal is optional but recommended. If you prefer, you can skip this exercise and use Git Bash directly (which you'll install in the next exercise).

## Step 1: Install Windows Terminal

### What This Step Does
This installs Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store (easiest method).

### Instructions
1. Press the Windows key
2. Type "microsoft store" and press Enter
3. In the store, search for "windows terminal"
4. Click on **Windows Terminal** (published by Microsoft Corporation)
5. Click **Install** or **Get**
6. Wait for installation to complete

**Alternative method (if store doesn't work):**
1. Go to [github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases)
2. Download the latest `.msixbundle` file
3. Double-click to install

### Verify
1. Press the Windows key
2. Type "windows terminal"
3. Press Enter
4. Windows Terminal should open

If Windows Terminal opens, the installation is successful.

## Step 2: Configure Windows Terminal (Optional)

### What This Step Does
This sets up Windows Terminal to use Git Bash as a profile option (you'll install Git Bash in the next exercise).

### Instructions
1. Open Windows Terminal
2. Click the dropdown arrow next to the new tab button
3. You should see options like "powershell", "command prompt", etc.
4. After you install Git Bash (in Exercise 2), it will automatically appear here

**Note:** We'll configure Git Bash integration after installing Git in Exercise 2.

### Verify
You should see:
- ✅ Windows Terminal opens successfully
- ✅ You can see the terminal interface
- ✅ You can create new tabs

---

## Expected State at the End of This Exercise

You should now have:
- **Windows Terminal**: Installed and accessible from the start menu
- **Basic Configuration**: Ready to add Git Bash in the next exercise

---

## Why This Matters

Windows Terminal provides:
- Better visual experience than default command prompt
- Multiple tabs for different shells
- Better customization options
- Integration with Git Bash, PowerShell, and other tools

While optional, Windows Terminal makes working with the command line more pleasant and professional.
