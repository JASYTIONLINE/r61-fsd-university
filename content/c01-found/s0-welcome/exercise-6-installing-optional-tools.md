# Exercise 3: Installing Optional Tools

This exercise is written so you can complete it **without an instructor present**.
Read each section fully before performing the steps.

This exercise covers optional tools mentioned in the [[s1-files/index|File Systems lecture]]. These tools are not required for this course but can enhance your productivity and learning experience.

---

## What You Are Building

By the end of this exercise, you will have (optionally):
- Cursor installed (AI-powered code editor)
- Obsidian installed (note-taking and knowledge management tool)

**Note:** Both tools are optional. You can complete this course using only VS Code (from Orientation) and basic note-taking. These tools are just enhancements if you want them.

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Windows computer with administrator access
- A working internet connection
- About 10-15 minutes (if installing both tools)
- VS Code already installed (from Orientation Exercise 3)

## Part 1: Installing Cursor (Optional)

### What Cursor Is
Cursor is an AI-powered code editor based on VS Code. It has built-in AI assistance that can help you write code, understand code, and debug problems.

### Why You Might Want It
- AI helps you write code faster
- Understands context of your project
- Can explain code you don't understand
- Helps with debugging
- Great learning tool for beginners

**Note:** Cursor is an alternative to VS Code. You can use either, but we'll primarily use VS Code in this course since it's the industry standard. Cursor is just an additional tool if you want AI assistance.

### Instructions
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
3. Click **Download**
4. Choose **Windows**
5. Once downloaded, run the installer
6. Follow the installation wizard (similar to VS Code)
7. When installation completes, launch Cursor

### Verify
1. Cursor should open
2. You should see a welcome screen or interface
3. You may be prompted to sign in or create an account (this is optional for now)

If Cursor opens, the installation is successful.

**Note:** You don't need to configure Cursor now. We'll primarily use VS Code in this course. Cursor is just available if you want to try AI-assisted coding.

## Part 2: Installing Obsidian (Optional)

### What Obsidian Is
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management tool that uses Markdown files. It's great for documenting what you learn and organizing your knowledge.

### Why You Might Want It
- Take notes on what you're learning
- Create your own documentation
- Link ideas together (helpful for learning)
- Organize your knowledge
- Works with plain text files (future-proof)

**Note:** Obsidian is optional. You can take notes in any text editor or even on paper. Obsidian is just a nice tool for organizing your learning.

### Instructions
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
3. Click **Download**
4. Choose **Windows**
5. Once downloaded, run the installer (obsidian-x.x.x.exe)
6. Follow the installation wizard:
   - Accept the license agreement
   - Choose installation location (default is fine)
   - Click **Install**
7. Wait for installation to complete
8. Click **Finish**

### Verify
1. Launch Obsidian
2. You'll be prompted to create or open a vault (a folder for your notes)
3. Choose **Create new vault**
4. Name it something like "my-learning-notes"
5. Choose a location (your documents folder is fine)
6. Click **Create**
7. You should see the Obsidian interface

If you can see the Obsidian interface and create a vault, the installation is successful.

## Expected State at the End of This Exercise

You should now have (optionally):
- **Cursor**: Installed and accessible (optional AI editor)
- **Obsidian**: Installed with a vault created (optional note-taking tool)

**Remember:** These tools are optional. You can complete this course without them. They're just enhancements if you want additional productivity tools.

---

## Why These Tools Matter (If You Choose to Use Them)

**Cursor:**
- Provides AI assistance while coding
- Can help you learn faster by explaining code
- Useful for debugging and understanding complex concepts

**Obsidian:**
- Helps you organize your learning
- Creates connections between concepts
- Builds a personal knowledge base
- Uses plain text files (works forever)

Both tools are optional but can enhance your development and learning experience if you choose to use them.

---

## Troubleshooting

If something didn't work:

1. **Cursor won't install**: Make sure you have administrator rights. Right-click the installer and choose "run as administrator."

2. **Obsidian won't create vault**: Make sure you have write permissions in the folder you're trying to use.

3. **Installation failed**: Check that you have enough disk space and administrator rights.

If you're still stuck, use ChatGPT or Google to search for your specific error message.
