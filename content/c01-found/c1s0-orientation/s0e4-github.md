# Exercise 4: Create and Configure Your GitHub Account

## Getting Started
GitHub is where you'll store your code online and build your portfolio. You need an account before you can use GitHub. 
### Prerequisites
Before You Start - Make sure you have:

- A working internet connection
- An email address (for creating the account)
- About 10-15 minutes
### What to Expect?
By the end of this exercise, you will have:

- A GitHub account created and verified
- Basic profile information set up
- Understanding of the GitHub interface
- Access to GitHub's features

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

### What This Step Does
This creates your GitHub account, which you'll use to store and share code.
#### Instructions
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
3. Click **Sign up** (top right corner)
4. Enter your email address
5. Create a password (make it strong and save it somewhere safe)
6. Choose a username (this will be part of your profile URL)
   - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
   - Avoid spaces and special characters
   - This username will be visible to others
   - Examples: `jane-doe`, `johndoe123`, `my-dev-account`
7. Verify you're not a robot (complete the verification)
8. Click **Create account**
9. Choose your plan (free is fine for learning)
10. Verify your email address:
    - Check your email inbox
    - Look for an email from GitHub
    - Click the verification link in the email
### Verify
You should now be able to:
- Log in to github.com
- See your profile page
- See the GitHub dashboard

If you can do these things, your GitHub account is ready.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Profile (Optional)

### What This Step Does
This makes your GitHub profile more professional and helps others understand who you are.
#### Instructions
1. While logged in to GitHub, click your profile picture (top right)
2. Click **Your profile**
3. Click **Edit profile** (button near your profile picture)
4. Fill in optional information:
   - **Name**: Your real name or professional name
   - **Bio**: Brief description (e.g., "Full Stack Developer in Training")
   - **Location**: Your city or region (optional)
   - **Website**: Your portfolio or blog (optional)
   - **Twitter/X**: Your social media handle (optional)
5. Click **Save changes**
### Verify
You should see:
- ✅ Your profile information updated
- ✅ A more complete profile page

**Note:** This step is optional but recommended. A complete profile looks more professional.

## Step 3: Explore the GitHub Interface

### What This Step Does
This helps you understand the basic GitHub interface so you can navigate it confidently.
#### Instructions
1. Look at the top navigation bar:
   - **GitHub logo**: Takes you to your dashboard
   - **Search bar**: Search for repositories, users, code
   - **+ icon**: Create new repository, organization, etc.
   - **Notifications**: See updates on your repositories
   - **Profile picture**: Access your profile and settings

2. Look at your dashboard:
   - **Repositories**: Lists your repositories (empty for now)
   - **Activity feed**: Shows activity from repositories you follow
   - **Explore**: Discover popular repositories and topics

3. Click on your profile picture → **Settings**:
   - Explore the settings menu (don't change anything yet)
   - See options for account, security, notifications, etc.
### Verify
You should understand:
- ✅ How to navigate the GitHub interface
- ✅ Where to find your repositories
- ✅ How to access settings
- ✅ Basic GitHub terminology

## Expected State at the End of This Exercise

You should now have:
- **GitHub account**: Created, verified, and accessible
- **Profile**: Set up (at least basic information)
- **Interface familiarity**: Understand basic navigation

---
## Why This Matters

You now have:
- A place to store your code online (GitHub)
- A professional profile that can become your portfolio
- Access to the largest developer community
- The foundation for all version control work in this course

This account will be used throughout the course. Every repository you create will be stored on GitHub, and your GitHub profile will become a portfolio of your work.

## Troubleshooting

If something didn't work:

1. **Can't create account**: Make sure your email is valid and you complete the verification step.

2. **Email verification not received**: Check your spam folder. If it's not there, you can request a new verification email from GitHub.

3. **Username already taken**: GitHub usernames must be unique. Try a different variation of your desired username.

If you're still stuck, use ChatGPT or Google to search for your specific error message.
