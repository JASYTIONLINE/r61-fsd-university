# What You Are Building
GitHub Desktop provides a visual interface for Git and GitHub, making version control easier for beginners. This exercise is part of the [[c01-found/c1s0-orientation/index|Orientation section]]. 

By the end of this exercise, you will have:
- GitHub Desktop installed
- GitHub Desktop signed in to your GitHub account
- Basic understanding of the GitHub Desktop interface

---
## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Windows computer with administrator access
- A working internet connection
- A GitHub account (created in Exercise 4)
- About 5-10 minutes

---
## Step 1: Download GitHub Desktop

### What This Step Does
This downloads the GitHub Desktop installer to your computer.
### Instructions
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
3. Click **Download for Windows**
4. Wait for the download to complete
### Verify
You should see a file named something like `githubdesktopsetup-x.x.x.exe` in your downloads folder.

---
## Step 2: Install GitHub Desktop

### What This Step Does
This installs GitHub Desktop on your computer.
### Instructions
1. Find the downloaded file in your downloads folder
2. Double-click the installer (githubdesktopsetup-x.x.x.exe)
3. If Windows asks for permission, click **Yes**
4. Follow the installation wizard:
   - Accept the license agreement
   - Choose installation location (default is fine)
   - Click **Install**
5. Wait for installation to complete
6. Click **Finish**
### Verify
1. Press the Windows key
2. Type "github desktop"
3. Press Enter
4. GitHub Desktop should open

If GitHub Desktop opens, the installation is successful.

---
## Step 3: Sign In to GitHub

### What This Step Does
This connects GitHub Desktop to your GitHub account so you can use it to manage repositories.

### Instructions
1. When GitHub Desktop opens, you'll be prompted to sign in
2. Click **Sign in to GitHub.com**
3. You'll be taken to a browser window
4. Click **Authorize GitHub Desktop**
5. You may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials
6. After authorization, return to GitHub Desktop
7. You should see the GitHub Desktop interface
### Verify
You should see:
- ✅ GitHub Desktop is signed in (your username should be visible)
- ✅ The main GitHub Desktop interface
- ✅ Options to create or clone repositories

If you can see the GitHub Desktop interface and you're signed in, the setup is successful.

---
## Step 4: Explore GitHub Desktop Interface

### What This Step Does
This helps you understand the basic GitHub Desktop interface.
### Instructions
1. Look at the main interface:
   - **File menu**: Create repository, clone repository, options
   - **Repository list**: Shows your repositories (empty for now)
   - **Changes tab**: Shows modified files (when you have a repository)
   - **History tab**: Shows commit history
   - **Branches tab**: Shows branches in your repository

2. Click **File** → **Options**:
   - Explore the settings (don't change anything yet)
   - See options for accounts, Git, appearance, etc.

3. Notice the interface is clean and simple—this is intentional. GitHub Desktop is designed to make Git easier to use.
### Verify
You should understand:
- ✅ Basic GitHub Desktop interface layout
- ✅ Where to find repository options
- ✅ How to access settings

**Note:** We won't use GitHub Desktop in detail yet. We're just getting it installed and connected to your account. You'll learn to use it in the Version Control section.

---
## Expected State at the End of This Exercise

You should now have:
- **GitHub Desktop**: Installed and accessible from the start menu
- **GitHub account**: Connected and signed in
- **Interface familiarity**: Understand basic navigation

---
## Why This Matters

GitHub Desktop provides:
- A visual way to use Git (easier for beginners)
- Easy way to see what files changed
- Simple interface for committing and pushing code
- Great learning tool for understanding Git concepts

While professional developers often use command-line Git, GitHub Desktop is an excellent learning tool and remains useful for visual workflows. You'll use both command-line Git and GitHub Desktop throughout this course.

---
## Troubleshooting

If something didn't work:

1. **GitHub Desktop won't sign in**: Check your internet connection and make sure your GitHub account email is verified.

2. **Installation failed**: Make sure you have administrator rights. Right-click the installer and choose "run as administrator."

3. **Can't find GitHub Desktop after installation**: Press Windows key, type "github desktop", and it should appear.

If you're still stuck, use ChatGPT or Google to search for your specific error message.
