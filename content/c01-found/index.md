# Foundations of Front-end Development

## About This Course

Welcome to the **Foundations of Front-end Development** course. This is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly program designed to teach you the essential skills needed to become a [front-end developer.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=e2877549ce424abf9b315d310a43615978f6699054321d9b29d7028045883848JmltdHM9MTc3MDg1NDQwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=07f802bb-eb29-6f86-2b0a-1404ea816ee4&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvRnJvbnQtZW5kX3dlYl9kZXZlbG9wbWVudA) 

This course is part of a larger [full-stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end) development series that will eventually cover the complete [MERN Stack](https://dev.to/utkarsh_singh_/understanding-the-mern-stack-a-beginners-guide-5d1k) (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Here, we focus on building a solid foundation in Front End Web Engineering:

- Creating your Knowledge Base with a solid expandable file structure
- **Version Control** - Professional Git and GitHub workflows
- **HTML & CSS** - Building and styling web pages
- **JavaScript Fundamentals** - Core programming concepts
- **Advanced JavaScript** - Functions, strings, and optimization
- **Modern Front-end Tools** - Tailwind CSS and advanced techniques

Although this course come with a complete lecture series and is designed to be experienced in a linear fashion starting with [Course 01 Section 0](c01-found/s0-welcome/index), each lesson is structured as a **workbook** that you can complete independent of the course lecture at your own pace, without requiring an instructor.

I do recommend completing the exercises in order since each exercise builds on the exercise preceding it. Upon completion of all the exercises, you will have a comprehensive portfolio-ready repository that demonstrates your skills as a Full Stack Engineer and a showcases the professional development practices you will develop throughout the course.
