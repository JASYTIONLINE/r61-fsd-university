# Foundations of Front-end Development

## About This Course

Welcome to the **Foundations of Front-end Development** course. This is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly program designed to teach you the essential skills needed to become a front-end developer. 

This course is part of a larger full-stack development series that will eventually cover the complete MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Here, we focus on building a solid foundation in:

- **Version Control** - Professional Git and GitHub workflows
- **HTML & CSS** - Building and styling web pages
- **JavaScript Fundamentals** - Core programming concepts
- **Advanced JavaScript** - Functions, strings, and optimization
- **Modern Front-end Tools** - Tailwind CSS and advanced techniques

Each lesson is structured as a **workbook** that you can complete at your own pace, without requiring an instructor. All exercises build on a single, portfolio-ready repository that demonstrates professional development practices.
